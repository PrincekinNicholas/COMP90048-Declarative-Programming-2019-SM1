 *     To solve the problem of math grid, as shown below:
 *     Here is an example puzzle as posed (left) and solved (right):
 *       ____ ____ ____ ____    ____ ____ ____ ____ 
 *      |    | 14 | 10 | 35 |  |    | 14 | 10 | 35 |
 *      | 14 |    |    |    |  | 14 |  7 |  2 |  1 |
 *      | 15 |    |    |    |  | 15 |  3 |  7 |  5 |
 *      | 28 |    |    |    |  | 28 |  1 |  1 |  7 |

 * details:
 * 
 *  A maths puzzle is a square grid of squares, each to be filled in 
 *          with a single digit 1 â€“ 9 (zero is not permitted)
 *          satisfying these constraints:
 *  - each row and each column contains no repeated digits;
 *  - all squares on the diagonal line from upper left to lower right 
 *          contain the same value; and
 *  - the heading of reach row and column (leftmost square in a row and 
            topmost square in a column) holds either the sum or the product 
            of all the digits in that row or column.
 * 
 * Note that the row and column headings are not considered to be part of 
 *     the row or column, and so may be filled with a number larger than 
 *     a single digit. The upper left corner of the puzzle is not meaningful.
 *
 * When the puzzle is originally posed, most or all of the squares
 *     will be empty, with the headings filled in. The goal of the puzzle
 *     is to fill in all the squares according to the rules. 
 *     A proper maths puzzle will have at most one solution.

The function puzzle_solution/1 takes a Puzzle

    and information of grid which needs to follow some constraints.
The argument Puzzle is actually a list of lists.
The function puzzle_solution/1 would firstly ascertain 
    the equal length of the puzzle by using maplist/2. 
Then, making sure all elements in the Puzzle are digits

Finally, grounding them if the variables are limited
