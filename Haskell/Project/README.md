You need to install Haskell GHCI or Haskell stack tool.

For example, you choose the later one.

# Testing your code
use the code below to going to the Prelude stage. Then you can test all function you wrote:
```bash
stack ghci
```
# Testing the project
For this project, before you test the project, you must totally understand what the purpose of the project, and understand what's the meaning of PITCH in this project.

The "P1", "P2", "P3" below are three different goal pitches which you can set whatever you like.   
Use "stack runhaskell Proj1Test.hs P1 P2 P3" to testing your project.

For instane, 
```bash
stack runhaskell Proj1Test.hs A1 A2 A3
```
The A1 A2 A3 above can be modified to your goal pitches.

Simply, one pitch contain 2 parts which are a letter and a number:
    The letter is belonging the range of A - G with Capital letter.
    The number is belonging the range of 1 - 3.
