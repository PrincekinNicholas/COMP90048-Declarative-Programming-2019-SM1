# COMP90048-Declarative-Programming-2019-SM1
This subject contains 2 parts: Haskell and Prolog

# Haskell
Haskell is a statically typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation.
It's one of declarative programming language.

### Install Haskell
I prefer use Haskell Stack Tool, which can be downloaded
[here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/)

### Testing your code
If you just want to test a specific function when your coding, you can use the code below in the terminal to turn to the Prelude stage. Then you can test whatever functions you wrote:
```bash
stack ghci
```

# Prolog
Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.

Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations.

### Install Prolog
Please check the latest version.
I used [this](http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable).

### Testing your code
If you just want to test a specific function when your coding, you can use the code below in the terminal. 
Then you can test whatever functions you wrote:
```bash
swipl
```

Then, using bracket such as,
```bash
[your_project_name].
``` 
without ".pl" to load your project.
